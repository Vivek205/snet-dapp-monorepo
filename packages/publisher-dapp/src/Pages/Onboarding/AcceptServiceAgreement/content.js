          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            If a Dispute is not resolved through Informal Negotiations and you live in the EU, you and us agree to try
            to resolve any and all Disputes, using the EU Online Dispute Resolution platform to reach an out-of-court
            settlement. The EU Online Dispute Resolution platform is developed and operated by the European Commission.
            The EU Online Dispute Resolution platform is user-friendly, multilingual and accessible to all. Everything
            is done in four, simple steps:&nbsp;
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span>
          <strong>i</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">) You fill in an online complaint form and submits it;&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span>
          <strong>ii</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">) the complaint is sent to Us;&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span>
          <strong>iii</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            ) Once You and Us agree on an Alternative Dispute Resolution entity to handle the dispute, the EU Online
            Dispute Resolution platform transfers automatically the complaint to that entity;&nbsp;
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span>
          <strong>iv</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            ) The Alternative Dispute Resolution entity handles the case entirely online and reaches an outcome in 90
            days.

          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            If you do not live in the EU or if a Dispute is not resolved through Informal Negotiations or the European
            Commission&rsquo;s Online Dispute Resolution platform, you and us agree on the following:&nbsp;
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span>
          <strong>i</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            ) Binding Arbitration. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or
            proceedings (collectively, &ldquo;
          </span>
          <strong>Disputes</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">

            or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without
            limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents,
          </span>
          <strong>
            the parties (a) waive respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this
            Agreement resolved in a court, and (b) waive respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, the parties will
            arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration
          </strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a
            final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in
            court).&nbsp;
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>

          <span style="font-weight: 400;">) No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. </span>
          <strong>
            Any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is personal and will be resolved solely through
            individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of
            representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempt
            to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute
            cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of
            arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals
          </strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

          <strong>iii</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            ) Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution. Each party will notify the other party in writing of any
            arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can
            attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to SingularityNET shall be sent by e-mail at
          </span>
          <strong>legal@singularitynet.io</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            . Notice to you shall be by email to the email address provided to SingularityNET. Your notice must include
            (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of
            the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and us cannot
            agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable
            party, then either you or us may, as appropriate and in accordance with this section commence an arbitration
            proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in section 6.8.5(i), file a claim in court.&nbsp;
          </span>

          <strong>iv</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            ) Process. Any arbitration will occur in the Netherlands. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a
            single arbitrator in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Netherlands Arbitration Institute (&ldquo;
          </span>
          <strong>NAI Rules</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            &rdquo;) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause.
            The language of the arbitration shall be English. The courts located in the Netherlands will have exclusive
            jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span>
          <strong>v</strong>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
            ) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all
            procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute
            is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court;
            provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a
            representative action, which is prohibited by this Agreement. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual
            arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual&rsquo;s claims, preside over any type of class
            or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.&nbsp;

            ) NAI Rules. NAI rules and additional information about the Netherlands Arbitration Institute are available
            on the Netherlands Arbitration Institute website (http://www.nai-nl.org). By agreeing to be bound by this
            Agreement, you either (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the NAI rules, or (ii)
            waive your opportunity to read the NAI rules and any claim that the NAI rules are unfair or should not apply
            for any reason.
